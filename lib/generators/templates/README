Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  Ensure you have set your project's Firebase project ID in config/initializers/fireify.rb.
  You can find this value in your Firebase console.

  You should store your project ID as an environment variable:

    Fireify.configure do |config|
      config.project_id = Rails.application.secrets.firebase[:project_id]
    end
